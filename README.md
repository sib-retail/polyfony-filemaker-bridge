## What is this ?

**This library cannot be used without the server part, which is not published anywhere.**

This library allows us to pass `Polyfony\Query` objects from web applications, to a remote Filemaker server which executes it and returns `Polyfony\Record` back. 
It has been developed because the old guy doing Filemaker stuff here doesn't keep up with new versions and didn't know that Filemaker has a nice REST API.
Not knowing this we had to develop this library which is quite hacky. We have to keep maintaining it for legacy purpose.
